# Analysis of Economic Policy Using Consumer Price Index (CPI)

This project analyzes the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for All Urban Consumers (CPI‑U) in the United States, focusing on data from October 2023 to January 2024. CPI is a key economic indicator used to measure inflation and understand changes in the cost of living.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to:
- Examine CPI trends across major expenditure categories
- Identify inflationary patterns
- Perform statistical analysis (summary statistics, correlation, hypothesis testing)
- Build predictive models
- Provide insights relevant to economic policy and consumer behavior 

## Summary Statistics
Key observations from descriptive statistics:
- Unadjusted percent changes show large fluctuations (min: −28.6%, max: +29%), reflecting real economic volatility.
- Seasonally adjusted changes show smoother variation, confirming the usefulness of seasonal adjustment.
- Relative importance ranges widely (0.008 to 79.79), highlighting the uneven weight of expenditure categories.

## Correlation Analysis
A correlation heatmap revealed:
- Strong positive correlations among all gasoline and motor fuel categories
- Negative correlations between motor fuels and fresh food categories
- Electricity and piped gas strongly correlated with each other but not with motor fuels
These relationships reflect underlying economic drivers such as oil prices, transportation costs, and regulatory differences.  

## Conclusion
The CPI analysis highlights:
- Stable inflation trends in essential categories
- Higher volatility in energy and certain food items
- Strong interdependencies among fuel-related categories
- The importance of seasonal adjustments for accurate economic interpretation
- These insights support informed decision‑making for policymakers, economists, and businesses.
